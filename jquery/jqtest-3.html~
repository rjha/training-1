			    Oh,I kept the first for another day! 
			    Yet knowing how way leads on to way
			    I doubted if I should ever come back.
			    <br>
			    I shall be telling this with a sigh
			    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
			    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
			    I took the one less traveled by,
			    And that has made all the difference.
